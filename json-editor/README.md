# json-editor

This is a supporting component of the Eurekan Bestiary. It's a barebones website that allows you to directly edit the
Bestiary JSON file.

## Setup

In a terminal:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

This will open the website locally. You need to copy the JSON as it currently exists and paste it into the textarea when
beginning to edit, as file access is difficult to do on a website. Edit what you want, and then click "show/hide json
export", copy what's in there, and replace the contents of the JSON file with it.
